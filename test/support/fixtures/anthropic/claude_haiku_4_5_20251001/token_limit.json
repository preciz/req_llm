          "text": "# The Dragon's Legacy: A Tale of Fire and Sky\n\n## Part One: The Awakening\n\nThe morning Kael discovered the dragon egg, the world changed forever.\n\nHe'd been climbing the Shattered Peaks—something he was strictly forbidden to do—when his boot dislodged a stone that tumbled down the mountainside and vanished into a fissure. Being the curious boy that he was, Kael followed it. The gap was barely wide enough for him to squeeze through, but on the other side opened a vast cavern he never knew existed.\n\nThe egg sat in a nest woven from silver branches and lined with down, positioned in a shaft of sunlight that streamed through a hole in the cave ceiling. It was the size of Kael's torso, with a shell that shimmered between deep crimson and burnished gold, as if it contained embers beneath its surface. Veins of light pulsed through the shell in a steady rhythm that matched Kael's own heartbeat.\n\nHe was seventeen years old, a scribe's apprentice in the village of Merrowdale, a boy who'd read every book in the tower library and dreamed of adventures beyond the quiet village nestled in the valley. His father had died in the mines three years prior. His mother worked as a weaver, her fingers perpetually stained with dye. She wanted him to be safe, to keep his head down, to survive quietly as most people did.\n\nBut Kael had never been good at quiet.\n\nHe touched the egg carefully. It was warm, almost hot, and the moment his skin made contact, the veins of light flared brilliantly. Kael gasped and pulled his hand back, but the egg remained stable, its pulse now synchronizing with his breathing instead of his heartbeat.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, though he wasn't sure why. \"I didn't mean to—\"\n\nA sound echoed through the cavern then, a long, mournful cry that seemed to come from everywhere at once. Kael's blood turned to ice. It was a sound of such profound loss that he felt tears prick his eyes. Without quite understanding why, he pressed both hands against the egg.\n\n\"It's okay,\" he said, repeating what he'd heard his mother say countless times when he was small and afraid. \"It's okay. You're not alone.\"\n\nThe egg stilled. The light beneath its surface faded to a gentle glow. And in the silence that followed, Kael made a decision that would alter the course of his entire life.\n\nHe couldn't leave it here.\n\n---\n\nGetting the egg down the mountain proved nearly impossible. It weighed perhaps as much as two large sacks of grain, heavy enough that Kael had to rig a harness from climbing rope and portions of his own cloak. He descended slowly, stopping frequently to rest, his muscles burning with effort. The sun was beginning to set by the time he reached the foothills, painting the sky in shades of orange and violet.\n\nHe couldn't take it to the village—that much he understood instinctively. The elders would see it as a threat. Dragons had disappeared from the world nearly a century ago, driven out or killed by the human kingdoms that had learned to fear and organize against them. The stories Kael had read spoke of a time before, when dragons and humans coexisted, not always peacefully, but at least sharing the same world. Now they were myth, bedtime stories told by grandmothers to explain the ancient ruins scattered across the continent.\n\nInstead, Kael took the egg to the Quiet Place.\n\nEvery person in Merrowdale knew the Quiet Place—a small, abandoned cottage near the edge of the village, sitting at the boundary between the cultivated farmland and the wild forests. It had belonged to an herbalist who'd died decades ago. The locals avoided it now, calling it unlucky, though it was actually just peacefully decaying, nature slowly reclaiming the structure. Kael had discovered it years ago and often went there to read and think.\n\nHe managed to carry the egg inside and hide it in the loft, arranging old sacking and straw around it to make a nest. The egg seemed to accept this, its internal light dimming to a soft, steady glow.\n\n\"Stay quiet,\" Kael told it. \"I'll come back. I'll bring food. I don't... I don't know how to feed a dragon, but I'll figure it out.\"\n\nOver the following weeks, Kael became adept at deception. He told his mother he'd been given additional duties at the library, which accounted for his increased time away from home. He brought the egg milk, honey, nuts, dried fruit, and meat when he could steal it from the larder. He wasn't sure what dragons actually ate, but the egg absorbed everything he left, the food seeming to simply dissolve against the shell and sink in, presumably nourishing whatever lay within.\n\nHe read voraciously during his time at the library, searching for any information about dragons. The records were fragmentary and often contradictory, written by scholars who were clearly working from imagination as much as fact. But he found a few threads of truth:\n\n*Dragons are born of flame and magic, from eggs that must be kept warm and protected. They bond with those who care for them in their formative stages. A dragon without bonds is a dragon prone to loneliness and rage.*\n\n*The last great dragon settlement was in the Northern Mountains, where a civilization of dragons thrived for over a thousand years. It ended in war—the exact cause is uncertain, but records suggest both internal conflict and external pressure from human kingdoms.*\n\n*A healthy dragon may live for centuries. Some accounts claim dragons were already ancient when humans built their first cities.*\n\n\"Centuries,\" Kael whispered to the egg one night, about three weeks after finding it. \"So if you hatch and survive, you could outlive everyone I know. Everyone they know. Everyone they'll ever know.\"\n\nThe egg pulsed gently, and for the first time, Kael wondered: what responsibility came with loving something so old and powerful? What burden was he assuming?\n\nBut he was seventeen, and seventeen-year-olds are rarely good at considering consequences before their hearts are committed to a course of action.\n\n---\n\nThe egg hatched on the spring equinox.\n\nKael didn't plan to be there, but a sick feeling woke him just before dawn, a kind of itch in his mind that wouldn't be soothed until he was moving toward the cottage. When he arrived, breathless and confused about what had compelled him to run from his bed so early, he found the egg in the final stages of hatching.\n\nThe shell was cracking along natural seams, and something inside was actively pushing. A sound accompanied this—not a cry exactly, but a high, sustained note that seemed to make the air itself vibrate. Kael watched in awe as the egg split into pieces, and from within emerged the dragon.\n\nIt was nothing like he'd imagined, and yet exactly what he should have expected.\n\nThe dragon was mostly neck and tail, with wings folded tight against its sides and legs that looked too delicate to support it. Its scales were still soft and gleaming, wet from emergence, showing the same interplay of crimson and gold that the egg had displayed. Its eyes—enormous, tilted slightly upward—opened and locked on Kael's immediately.\n\nKael felt something shift in his chest, like a door opening that he didn't know existed.\n\n\"Hello,\" he breathed.\n\nThe dragon tried to stand, failed, collapsed back into the scattered eggshell fragments. It made a small, distressed sound.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Kael said, moving slowly forward. \"You're okay. You just need a moment. You've been growing inside that shell your whole life. Your legs need to remember how to work.\"\n\nHe wasn't sure how he knew what to say, but the words felt true as he spoke them. He sat down across from the dragon, meeting those vast, bewildered eyes.\n\n\"My name is Kael,\" he said. \"I found you. You were alone, and I couldn't leave you there. And now you're here, and I'm going to take care of you. That's... that's going to be my job now.\"\n\nThe dragon lifted its head, a motion that seemed to require enormous effort. It took a wobbly step forward, then another, each movement slightly more confident than the last. It approached Kael, sniffed curiously at his hair, his face, his hands, its warm breath carrying a scent like cinnamon and smoke.\n\nThen it curled up on his lap—all those long limbs somehow condensing into something almost cat-like—and fell asleep.\n\nKael sat frozen, barely breathing, afraid that any movement might disturb this moment. A dragon was sleeping in his lap. A dragon that had just been born. A dragon that needed him.\n\nOutside the cottage, the sun rose fully. Merrowdale continued about its morning routines, entirely unaware that the world had changed again.\n\n---\n\nKael named the dragon Embercall, after a word he found in an old text—one of the few dragon names that had survived through the centuries. The name felt right the moment he said it aloud, and the dragon opened one eye at the sound, as if acknowledging its own name for the first time.\n\n\"Embercall,\" he repeated. \"You're Embercall.\"\n\nThe first weeks were chaos masked by desperate improvisation. Embercall grew with alarming speed, expanding like someone inflating a balloon, its wings beginning to truly unfold, its teeth coming in sharp and dangerous. It ate like a creature possessed, consuming everything Kael provided and demanding more. Kael had to become better at stealing food, having to raid the markets at night, making excuses about increased hunger.\n\n\"You're a growing boy,\" his mother would say approvingly, completely unaware of the literal dragon his son was secretly feeding.\n\nEmbercall's personality developed quickly as well. The dragon was curious about everything, investigating the corners of the cottage with the methodical persistence of a child. It was playful, delighting in chasing Kael around the space, its claws clicking against the wooden floors. It was also temperamental—when it didn't get food immediately upon demanding it, Embercall would knock things over with its growing tail, scorching the walls with flames that emerged from its nostrils like small, controlled bursts.\n\nThese flames terrified Kael initially, but he quickly realized that Embercall was deliberately avoiding burning him or the cottage. The dragon was showing remarkable control over its own power, as if instinctively understanding that destruction wasn't the goal.\n\n\"You're smart,\" Kael told the dragon, running his hands along its neck scales, which had hardened and now felt warm and slightly rough, like fine leather. \"You're really, incredibly smart.\"\n\nEmbercall rumbled, a sound like distant thunder that seemed to come from deep in its chest. When Kael pressed his ear against the dragon's side, he could hear its heartbeat beneath the sound, a strong, regular pulse that gave him comfort in a way he couldn't fully explain.\n\nBut the cottage couldn't remain secret forever.\n\n---\n\nIt was a girl named Sylvie who discovered them.\n\nSylvie was the blacksmith's daughter, a year older than Kael, with dark eyes and hands perpetually stained with soot. They'd known each other their entire lives but had never been particularly close until the day she followed him to the cottage.\n\nKael had been sloppy, leaving tracks in mud that led from the village to the old herbalist's home. Sylvie, who'd always been observant in the way that people who work with their hands often are, had noticed and followed out of simple curiosity.\n\nShe was stepping into the cottage door when Embercall, now nearly the size of a horse and exponentially more impressive, rounded a corner and saw her.\n\nSylvie screamed. Embercall hissed, defensive, raising its wings. Kael, who'd been outside gathering firewood, ran in to find his secret literally about to explode.\n\n\"It's okay!\" he cried out, moving between them. \"Sylvie, this is Embercall. Embercall, this is Sylvie. Everyone, please be calm!\"\n\n\"There's a dragon in the cottage,\" Sylvie said flatly, as if she was asking for confirmation of something her eyes were telling her but her mind refused to accept.\n\n\"Yes,\" Kael admitted.\n\n\"A dragon. You have a dragon.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In an abandoned cottage. That you've been secretly visiting.\"\n\n\"... Yes.\"\n\nSylvie stared at him for a long moment. Then she began to laugh",
